Bayesian Inference & Aviation Accident Probability ✈️

This project explores the use of Bayesian inference to model and analyse the probability of aviation accidents based on various risk factors. It was submitted as part of my AI coursework for the BSc Computer Science program at the University of Roehampton, where it received the highest Essay mark ever awarded in the module.

📄 Key Features:
An in-depth essay combining AI theory with real-world aviation data
A prototype tool that demonstrates how Bayesian models can be applied to enhance aerospace safety decision-making
Clear explanation of concepts like conditional probability, prior/posterior beliefs, and inference in uncertain environments
🛠 Technologies:
Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualisations
Bayesian statistics principles
🧠 Background:
As someone with a long-standing interest in aviation, I aimed to bridge that passion with my academic focus on AI and data science. The result is a small but meaningful project that highlights how AI can contribute to improving safety in high-risk domains like aerospace.

Let me know if you want to include sample visuals, graphs, or a walkthrough video — those can make the repo even more engaging!
